## What are we going to do?

Information is organized on [AsULearn](http://asulearn.appstate.edu) and our [web page](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/DataScience1/).

* 60% of your course grade will come from DataCamp
* 10% of your course grade will come from your web page
* 10% of your course grade will come from Project 1
* 10% of your course grade will come from Project 2
* 10% of your course grade will come from Project 3
* Receive credit for Human Subject Research Ethics

Both the course web page and this presentation were created using R Markdown in RStudio and published via GitHub. You will create and publish your own web page in this class. Exciting!


## How are we going to do it?

There will be very little lecturing in this course. Instead, class time will be largely devoted to working on DataCamp modules, projects, and other hands-on assignments. That way, you can get timely help from your peers and the instructor. 

I strongly encourage you to work your peers with and "crowd source" knowledge within the class. Everyone brings a different skill set to this course and those strengths complement each another. One of the best ways to learn concepts is to explain them to someone else!

Jump in, give it a try, don't be afraid to make mistakes.
