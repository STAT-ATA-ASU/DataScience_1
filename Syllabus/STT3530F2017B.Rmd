**Course Description:**  

This course is an introduction to the basics of data management and visualization, including reproducible workflow. Topics include introductory concepts of programming and work flow, data manipulation, and data visualization using grammar of graphics. The course will also emphasize the practice of creating reproducible research using a version control system with dynamic document reporting, including tools such as R, R Studio, R Markdown, and Git.  

**Course Objectives:**

1.  Students will learn how to use a reproducible research work flow.
2.  Students will improve their technology expertise.
3.  Students will learn to work with large data sets.
4.  Students will learn the grammar of `ggplot2`.
5. Students will learn to display their work on the web.
6. Students will learn how to read data into R.
7. Students will learn to store data in a `tidy` format.



**Course Texts:**

[_R for Data Science_](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)


**Course Grading & Assessment:**

The only way to learn statistics is to **DO** statistics, which includes statistical software. Reading the textbook, learning the language, and practicing exercises using real data are critical to your learning and success. Class activities and assessments have been structured with these principles in mind. 

You should read assigned textbook content and read/watch supplemental materials prior to coming to class.  It will be easier to participate if you acquire some familiarity with the vocabulary and methods before we start to discuss and use them. You must "speak the language" (both statistics and R) to effectively demonstrate your knowledge. 

Appalachian students are expected to make intensive engagement with courses their first priority. Practically speaking, students should spend about 1-3 hours on coursework outside of class for every hour they spend in class. 

* 60% of the course grade will come from the thirteen DataCamp assignments

* 15% of the course grade will be for the design and creation of your web page 

* 25% of the course grade will come from the final project


Grades will be kept on AsULearn. You should monitor your grades throughout the term to make sure they appear to be correct and complete. Feel free to inquire about your grades at any time.       

**How To Get Unstuck**

Well constructed questions will elicit answers more rapidly than poorly constructed questions.  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY&list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNSDfcKPFH2gzHGyjpeCZmJ&index=3) provides some background on asking questions.  This stackoverflow thread details how to create a [minimal R reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610). Please read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond and Rick Moen and heed their advice.

**University Policies**
